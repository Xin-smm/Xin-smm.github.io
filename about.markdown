### What Is This Website About

This website is created mainly for updating my notes that's written in my OI class. And also just to log those Codes that I've wrote because I don't want to simply delete them and it's just *kind of hard* to manage them locally.

### What Can You See Here

As I mentioned, you can see all my notes that is updated and **ANY THING** I've updated here.

### Why Did I Create The Website

It's mainly because I want to find a more efficient way to manage my notes, also because it's really fun to *create* a website, *isn't it?* And there's a lot of things I want to add to this website.

### The Stuffs I Used To Create This

To create this website, I use **Github Page** and **Jekyll**, which is really straightforward to use, especially for those people who don't know anything about **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**, i.e. *me*.
